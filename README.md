# Java-Battleships

A recreation of the classic game "Battleship" - a project for learning Java.

This project was started within my first week at the University of Southampton. I chose this as a starting point to learn object oriented programming. Unfortunately due to coursework, I stopped working on this project, but I hope to return to it in the future.
